# Digital Color Clock
### http://matthewrice.github.io/Digital-Color-Clock/
### Unit: Introduction to JavaScript
### Week: 2
### Tools: HTML, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript

This assignment was the first time I worked with JavaScript outside of the pre-work I was assigned.  

The purpose of the assignment was to introduce me to... 
  - general JS syntax
  - functions that achieve a series of steps
  - arrays and loops
  - math operations
  - string operations
  - DOM accessors
  - breaking down a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of JS statements

This project does the following...
  - updates the current time every second
  - renders a 12 hour clock
  - shows a progress bar that advances as the seconds go by
  - changes the background color every second
  - displays the hex color code when the cursor hovers over the time.
